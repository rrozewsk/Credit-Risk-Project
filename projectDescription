1.	Title: CDO Pricing and Copula Change
2.	Abstract: We want to understand how changing the copula can change the tranche pricing.
3.	Introduction – A fat tail adjustment or a change to a different probability distribution can affect how tranches are priced. Does changing the copula change the price enough to make the product undesirable to investors? Should we rely on simulated defaults or should we use historical default figures for worst case scenarios?
4.	Problem Description: 
How best do we estimate tail probability events and incorporate them into CDO pricing.
1.	Show the theory behind the different probability copulas and python code to compute things
5.	Results – Compare the outcomes in Excel files.
6.	Discussion – Discuss the benefits and flaws of modeling CDOs under each copula. Try and understand the implications of each pricing strategy with respect to regulation and practical uses.
