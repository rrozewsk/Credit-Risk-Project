### Instructor-specified goals ###

+ [ ] Do the following in MonteCarloSimulators/Vasicek/vasicekMCSim.py: 
    - [ ] Create a method to calculate average of simulations.
    - [ ] Include average of simulations as column 0 in getLibor() method.
    - [ ] Include a method that will determine Vasicek perameters (`x`)
        from interest rate curve ('Z') using scipy optimize
    - [ ] Include a method that will determine Vasicek perameters from
        credit curve ('Q') using scipy optimize.
+ [ ] Create the file `exponentialMCSim.py` in
      MonteCarloSimulators/Exponential.
+ [ ] Create the file `CIRMCSim.py` in MonteCarloSimulators/CIR
+ [ ] Do the following:
    - [ ] Create/finish the Bond class.
    - [ ] Create/finish the Bond test.
+ [ ] Create a CVA class. Pricing should be calculated in two ways:
      using the credit curve as input and/or using the interest as
      input.
+ [ ] Create a CDSBootStrapper class that generates credit curve from
      list of CDS prices.
+ [ ] Use the Vasicek & CDSBootStrapper classes & Quandl to generate
      credit curves for every credit rating.


### Other goals ###

+ [ ] Include docstrings on ALL modules, classes, and public methods.
    - [x] MonteCarloSimulators/Vasicek/vasicekMCSim.py
    - [ ] Products/Credit/CDS.py
    - [ ] Products/Rates/Bond.py
    - etc. 
+ [ ] Add all binaries (.pyc, .pyo, __pycache__) to .gitignore.
+ [ ] Ask the prof if we can open source the project. Then determine 
      which, if any, open source license to use.
+ [ ] The code is poorly architectured. Ask the prof if we can refactor.
